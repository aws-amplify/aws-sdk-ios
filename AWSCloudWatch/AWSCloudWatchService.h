/**
 <p>Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real-time. You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are the variables you want to measure for your resources and applications.</p><p>CloudWatch alarms send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring based on rules that you define. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then use this data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.</p><p>In addition to monitoring the built-in metrics that come with AWS, you can monitor your own custom metrics. With CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.</p>

Optionally, this operation can associate one or more Amazon SNS resources with the alarm.</p><p> When this operation creates an alarm, the alarm state is immediately set to <code>INSUFFICIENT_DATA</code>. The alarm is evaluated and its <code>StateValue</code> is set appropriately. Any actions associated with the <code>StateValue</code> are then executed. </p><note><p>When updating an existing alarm, its <code>StateValue</code> is left unchanged, but it completely overwrites the alarm's previous configuration.</p></note><note><p>If you are using an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) account to create or modify an alarm, you must have the following Amazon EC2 permissions:</p><ul><li><p><code>ec2:DescribeInstanceStatus</code> and <code>ec2:DescribeInstances</code> for all alarms on Amazon EC2 instance status metrics.</p></li><li><p><code>ec2:StopInstances</code> for alarms with stop actions.</p></li><li><p><code>ec2:TerminateInstances</code> for alarms with terminate actions.</p></li><li><p><code>ec2:DescribeInstanceRecoveryAttribute</code>, and <code>ec2:RecoverInstances</code> for alarms with recover actions.</p></li></ul><p>If you have read/write permissions for Amazon CloudWatch but not for Amazon EC2, you can still create an alarm but the stop or terminate actions won't be performed on the Amazon EC2 instance. However, if you are later granted permission to use the associated Amazon EC2 APIs, the alarm actions you created earlier will be performed. For more information about IAM permissions, see <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PermissionsAndPolicies.html">Permissions and Policies</a> in <i>Using IAM</i>.</p><p>If you are using an IAM role (e.g., an Amazon EC2 instance profile), you cannot stop or terminate the instance using alarm actions. However, you can still see the alarm state and perform any other actions such as Amazon SNS notifications or Auto Scaling policies.</p><p>If you are using temporary security credentials granted using the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS), you cannot stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance using alarm actions.</p></note>
