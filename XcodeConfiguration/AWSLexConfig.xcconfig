// Add arm64 to EXCLUDED_ARCHS for iOS simulator version 14
// This is to temporarily fix issues with Xcode 12, since Xcode 12 supports Apple Silicon Macs using arm64,
// but most libraries currently haven't been built with arm64 support for simulator. AWSLex internally uses
// libBlueAudioSourceiOS static library which do not have support for arm64 simulator
//
// NOTE: EXCLUDED_ARCHS is a new feature of Xcode 12. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode-release-notes/xcode-12-release-notes#Build-System
// Nevertheless, it appears that while Xcode 11 does not support this feature, it notices the build setting and does
// weird things as a result, breaking the build on Xcode 11. To keep using Xcode 11, we found that we can
// use 14* instead of *. also we can just comment this line out.
EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator14*] = arm64
