## Introduction

AWS Mobile SDK for iOS offers a set of SDKs which make working with AWS easy. You could leverage services like `S3`, `AppSync`, `IoT`, `CognitoUserPools`, `DynamoDB`, and many other in your application with very few steps. We also provide utility clients like `S3TransferUtility`, `Auth`, `DynamoDB`, etc. which further simplify interaction with the cloud!
