The <code>cors</code> subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size. </p><p>When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the <code>cors</code> configuration on the bucket and uses the first <code>CORSRule</code> rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:</p><ul><li><p>The request&rsquo;s <code>Origin</code> header must match <code>AllowedOrigin</code> elements.</p></li><li><p>The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> header in case of a pre-flight <code>OPTIONS</code> request must be one of the <code>AllowedMethod</code> elements. </p></li><li><p>Every header specified in the <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> request header of a pre-flight request must match an <code>AllowedHeader</code> element. </p></li></ul><p> For more information about CORS, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html\">Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p><p class=\"title\"><b>Related Resources</b></p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketCors.html\">GetBucketCors</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketCors.html\">DeleteBucketCors</a></p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTOPTIONSobject.html\">RESTOPTIONSobject</a></p></li></ul></p>","parent_name":"AWSS3"},"Classes/AWSS3.html#/c:objc(cs)AWSS3(im)putBucketEncryption:":{"name":"-putBucketEncryption:","abstract":"<p><p>This implementation of the <code>PUT</code> operation uses the <code>encryption</code> subresource to set the default encryption state of an existing bucket.</p><p>This implementation of the <code>PUT</code> operation sets default encryption for a bucket using server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys SSE-S3 or AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) (SSE-KMS).

A select request doesn’t return error response <code>409</code>.</p></li></ul><p><b>Restoring Archives</b></p><p>Objects in the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage classes are archived. To access an archived object, you must first initiate a restore request. This restores a temporary copy of the archived object. In a restore request, you specify the number of days that you want the restored copy to exist. After the specified period, Amazon S3 deletes the temporary copy but the object remains archived in the GLACIER or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class that object was restored from. </p><p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don&rsquo;t provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p><p>The time it takes restore jobs to finish depends on which storage class the object is being restored from and which data access tier you specify. </p><p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p><ul><li><p><b><code>Expedited</code></b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the GLACIER storage class when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p></li><li><p><b><code>Standard</code></b> - S3 Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for the GLACIER and DEEP_ARCHIVE retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. S3 Standard retrievals typically complete within 3-5 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 12 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. </p></li><li><p><b><code>Bulk</code></b> - Bulk retrievals are Amazon S3 Glacier’s lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours from the GLACIER storage class and typically complete within 48 hours from the DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class.</p></li></ul><p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html\">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p><p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. You upgrade the speed of an in-progress restoration by issuing another restore request to the same object, setting a new <code>Tier</code> request element. When issuing a request to upgrade the restore tier, you must choose a tier that is faster than the tier that the in-progress restore is using. You must not change any other parameters, such as the <code>Days</code> request element. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html\"> Upgrading the Speed of an In-Progress Restore</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>. </p><p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide</i>.</p><p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p><p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days.
