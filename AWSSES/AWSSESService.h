 Returns the singleton service client. If the singleton object does not exist, the SDK instantiates the default service client with `defaultServiceConfiguration` from `[AWSServiceManager defaultServiceManager]`. The reference to this object is maintained by the SDK, and you do not need to retain it manually.

 For example, set the default service configuration in `- application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`
 
 *Swift*

     func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        let credentialProvider = AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider(regionType: .USEast1, identityPoolId: "YourIdentityPoolId")

        AWSServiceManager.default().defaultServiceConfiguration = configuration
 
        return true
