  - Added a configurable option to disable & hide the "Create new account" (SignUp) button in the Amazon Cognito User Pools UI. See [PR #1094](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/pull/1094). Thanks @jamesingham!

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon Pinpoint**
  - Fixed a deadlock that can occur when adding events from the main queue
    while the app is moving to the background or manually stopping a Pinpoint
    session.

* **AWSCore**
  - Fixed threading issue in `AWSCredentialsProvider`. See [PR #1192](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/pull/1192/files). Thanks @fer662!

    (e.g., "us-east-1") from an AWSRegionType

## 2.9.0

### Misc. Updates

* **Amazon S3**
  * **Breaking API Change** The return value for the `S3TransferUtilityForKey` method is set to nullable and will map to an Optional type in Swift. The `S3TransferUtilityForKey` method is typically used in conjunction with a previously registered client (using one of the `registerS3TransferUtility*` methods). The lookup will return a null value if the registration had failed due to errors instantiating the client. 

* **Amazon Transcribe**
  * **Breaking API Change** The enum value `EnUK` in the `AWSTranscribeLanguageCode` enum has been replaced with `EnGB`.

   * Don't embed Swift libraries with AWSMobileClient.framework See [issue #1123](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/issues/1123)
   * Fixed issue where Xcode would log a warning for `AWSAuthUI.bundle` not being loaded as SDK would incorrectly try to load executable for `AWSAuthUI.bundle` which only contains resources. See [issue #1107](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/issues/1107)
   * Added `getUserAttributes` method which fetches attributes of signed in user. See [issue #123](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-ios/issues/123)

## 2.7.2

### Bug Fixes

* **AWSCognitoAuth**
  * Fixed bug where the `completeGetSession:` callback would be invoked with an
    error if `safariViewController:didCompleteInitialLoad:` is invoked after a
    redirection (e.g., as can happen if an external identity provider bypasses
    the login screen for an already-authenticated user). See
    [PR #1100](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/pull/1110)
  * Fixed bug where the callback to `getSession` would not be given in case the customer dismisses the `SFSafariViewController`. See [PR #1109](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/pull/1109)

## 2.7.1

### New Features

* **AWS Core**
  * Added support for `us-gov-east-1` - AWS GovCloud (US East) region.

### Bug Fixes

* **Amazon Cognito Identity Provider**
  * Deprecate `claims` property of `AWSCognitoIdentityUserSessionToken` since
      it incorrectly declares the type as `NSDictionary<NSString*, NSString*>`.
      Instead, callers should use `tokenClaims`, which has the proper type of
      `NSDictionary<NSString*, id>`. See [PR #1068](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios/pull/1068)

       > Note: The existing `claims` property is deprecated and will be removed in a future minor version.

### Misc. Updates

* Model updates for the following services
  * Amazon EC2

## 2.7.0

### New Features

* **AWS Mobile Client**
  * The `AWSMobileClient` provides client APIs and building blocks for developers who want to create user authentication experiences.  It supports the following new features:
    - User state tracking: `AWSMobileClient` offers on-demand querying for the “login state” of a user in the application. 
    - Credentials management: Automatic refreshing of `Cognito User Pools` `JWT Token` and `AWS Credentials` from `Cognito Identity`.
    - Offline support: `AWSMobileClient` is optimized to account for applications transitioning from offline to online connectivity, and refreshing credentials at the appropriate time so that errors do not occur when actions are taken and connectivity is not available. 
    - Drop-in Auth UI: `AWSMobileClient` client supports easy “drop-in” UI for your application.
    - Simple, declarative APIs `signUp`, `signIn`, `confirmSignIn`, etc.

> Note: The existing methods of `AWSMobileClient` are deprecated and will be removed in a future minor version. `AWSMobileClient` now takes a dependency on `AWSCognitoIdentityProvider`(Cognito User Pools SDK) package to offer integration with `CognitoUserPools`. When using the new drop-in UI, `AWSAuthUI` and `Social sign-in` features continue to be pluggable dependencies for `AWSMobileClient`.

All documentation is now centralized at [https://aws-amplify.github.io/](https://aws-amplify.github.io/)

### New Features
* **Amazon Cognito** - is a simple user identity and synchronization service that helps you securely manage and synchronize app data for your users across their mobile devices. With Amazon Cognito, you can save any kind of data, such as app preferences or game state, in the AWS Cloud without writing any backend code or managing any infrastructure.
* **Amazon Mobile Analytics** - is a service for collecting, visualizing and understanding app usage data at scale. Amazon Mobile Analytics reports are typically updated within 60 minutes from when data are received. Amazon Mobile Analytics is built to scale with the business and can collect and process billions of events from millions of endpoints.
* **Amazon Kinesis Recorder** - enables you to reliably record data to an Amazon Kinesis data stream from your mobile app. Kinesis Recorder batches requests to handle intermittent network connection and enable you to record events even when the device is offline.
* **Amazon DynamoDB Object Mapper** - We have made it easier to use DynamoDB from the AWS SDK for iOS by providing the DynamoDB Object Mapper for iOS. The DynamoDB Object Mapper makes it easy to set up connections to a DynamoDB database and supports high-level operations like creating, getting, querying, updating, and deleting records.
* **Amazon S3 Transfer Manager** - We have rebuilt the S3TransferManager to utilize BFTask in AWS SDK for iOS. It has a clean interface, and all of the operations are now asynchronous.
* **ARC support** - The AWS SDK for iOS is now ARC enabled from the ground up to improve overall memory management.
* **BFTask support** - With native BFTask support in the AWS SDK for iOS, you can chain async requests instead of nesting them. This makes the logic cleaner while keeping the code more readable.
* **Conforming Objective-C recommendations** - The AWS SDK for iOS conforms to Objective-C best practices. The SDK returns NSErrors instead of throwing exceptions. iOS developers will now feel at home when using the AWS Mobile SDK.
* **Official CocoaPods support** - Including the AWS SDK for iOS in your project is now easier than ever. You just need to add pod "AWSiOSSDKv2" and pod "AWSCognitoSync" to your Podfile.
