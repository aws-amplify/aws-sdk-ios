# A list of frameworks/packages for the AWS iOS SDK. As of now, order on these
# packages is important, since we don't model dependencies in code that we
# consume for the release process. Packages toward the bottom of the list
# depend on packages toward the top of the list.

# Note that this list isn't a comprehensive list of Xcode schemas or targets
# that need to be built and tested, only a model of dependencies for cocoapods.
