If the singleton object does not exist, the SDK instantiates the default service client with `defaultServiceConfiguration` from `[AWSServiceManager defaultServiceManager]`.

 For example, set the default service configuration in `- application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

        let credentialProvider = AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider(regionType: .USEast1, identityPoolId: "YourIdentityPoolId")

        AWSServiceManager.default().defaultServiceConfiguration = configuration

 <p>Writes multiple data records into a delivery stream in a single call, which can achieve higher throughput per producer than when writing single records. To write single data records into a delivery stream, use <a>PutRecord</a>. Applications using these operations are referred to as producers.</p><p>Each <a>PutRecordBatch</a> request supports up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1,000 KB (before 64-bit encoding), up to a limit of 4 MB for the entire request.

Note that if you use <a>PutRecord</a> and <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, the limits are an aggregate across these two operations for each delivery stream.
