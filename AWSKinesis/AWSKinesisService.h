If the singleton object does not exist, the SDK instantiates the default service client with `defaultServiceConfiguration` from `[AWSServiceManager defaultServiceManager]`.

 For example, set the default service configuration in `- application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

        let credentialProvider = AWSCognitoCredentialsProvider(regionType: .USEast1, identityPoolId: "YourIdentityPoolId")

Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.</p><p>Each data record can be up to 1 MB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MB per second.

If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next one second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> won't return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait one second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>; however, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.</p><p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute.
